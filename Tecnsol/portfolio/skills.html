            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>I started coding about a year and a half ago, although I think I wasted most of that time. Well, I'm not that sad about it. Even though I wasted that time, I was still active in a lot of programming groups and Discords. This allowed me to form a team of my own, consisting of four people with different skill sets but the same ambition to learn how to code and become good programmers. Since we were all new to programming, we learned new topics and taught each other, which helped me learn new topics quickly and gave me motivation to learn more. I wanted to help my friends who were learning with me. Because of them, I started learning Python, a well-known programming language in the programming community. I spent a couple of months learning new skills, new modules, and working on new projects. To view any of my projects, please <a href="https://github.com/OniChan-Baka" target="_blank">click here</a>. With the help of these projects, I was able to become somewhat proficient in Python, which led me to apply for a certificate. To my surprise, I actually passed the test with a perfect score and obtained the certificate.</p>
